[uefi app]
    i am going to write a uefi-os-loader.
    [X]build envirenement able to load efi application.
    [] play enaugh with the boot and run time services.
    [] get every thing necessary and (memory map, hardware detection and pass it to kernel).
    [] write time os-loader.
    [] i need to place the kernel on the disk and then boot it.
    [] boot my kernel onto it, so i can get runtime services to play with graphics

    improvements:
    [] make most params changeable and passed by command line
    [] change to way i compile so that i ll be able to perform correct calling convention
    [] comment the code.
